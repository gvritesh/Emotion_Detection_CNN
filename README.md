# Emotion_Detection_CNN
+ Addressed class imbalance in the FER-2013 dataset by employing image augmentation and class weights, improving model robustness.
+ Designed and iterated on custom CNN models, including advanced architectures like VGG16 and ResNet50v2, to optimize performance.
+ Achieved a 64% overall accuracy with final model based on ResNet50v2, detailed through precision, recall, F-1 scores and AUC ROC plots across 7 emotion labels.
+ Deployed the model for real-time emotion detection using Gradio and OpenCV, showcasing emotion labels dynamically on-screen.
